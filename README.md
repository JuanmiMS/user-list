# Installation and deploy

First of all we need to install all the depencencies with `npm install`. Then, depending
of what version we want, we can run this different commands:

To run the project in develop mode: `npm run dev`

To run the project in production mode: `npm run build`

PSA: after running `npm run build`, a new folder called 'build' will appear, you only need to open the file index.html with your favourite browser.
